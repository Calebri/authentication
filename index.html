    <p>This page lists accounts that are owned by me. Accounts not on this list are either fake or I don't care about them. All accounts listed will link back to this page. Basically, if an account is on this list and links back to this site, I own it. The parentheses will show you how exactly the accounts link (some accounts like Roblox don't allow direct links to this page)</p>
